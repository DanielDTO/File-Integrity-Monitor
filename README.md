<h1>File Integrity Monitor</h1>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<b>The project's objective is to confirm the integrity of files in a directory using a PowerShell script. Integrity is a key security concept and this is accomplished through the use of Hash algorithms.
</b>
<br />
<br />
The script creates hashes of files using the set hashing funtion. This hash is in turn saved to a baseline file and is used for comparison to establish if the file has been modified, deleted or remained the same.
<br />

<h2>Languages Used</h2>
